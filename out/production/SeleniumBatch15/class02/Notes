WebElement: Everything we see on a webpage is a webelement.

Selenium Locators:
1) ID
2) Name
3) class
4) linkText ==> This can only be used with links and it must have a text. (a link is usually place in tag <a>).
5) Xpath
6) Css
7) tagName ==> Just specify the tag that u want to find (When we search for tag we //a which means find me <a>)
8) Partial LinkText.  ==> This can only be used with links and it must have a text. (a link is usually place in tag <a>).

Why do we need locators? ==> Whenever we need to find a particular webElement, we use locators.

Why do we need so many locator? ==> 1) sometimes there might be a locator with duplicate value.
2) sometimes the developers might not provide you with all the locators.

There are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator:
1) if an attribute value has a number in it, it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator because the number can be dynamic.

If you inspect a website and then press ctrl+f it will open search in the elements section of inspection
and you can then find anything such as title.
