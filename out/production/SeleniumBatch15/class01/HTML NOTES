Usually every tag has a corresponding closing tag and some tags will not have closing tags.
HTML Openning Tag <html> and HTML Clossing tag </html>

<html> all code should be here </html>  ==> html is a parent tag.

<html>                                              // This is the parent tag for body
    <body>                                          // This is parent tag for h1 and h2 // h1 and h2 are siblings
            <h1> hello </h1>                        // text is between opening and closing tags such as <input>I am a text</input>
            <h2> How are you </h2>
    </body>
</html>
